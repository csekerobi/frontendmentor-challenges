# Frontend Mentor Challenges Repository

Welcome to the **Frontend Mentor Challenges Repository**! This repo contains multiple solutions to various challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), where you can improve your front-end development skills by working on real-world projects.

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific challenge from Frontend Mentor, and inside each folder, you'll find the **Live Site**, a **Screenshot** and **Design Preview** for that challenge.

## What You Will Find Inside Each Challenge Folder

1. **Solution to the Challenge**  
   Each folder contains the completed solution for the respective challenge. The folder will include:

- HTML files with semantic markup.
- CSS for styling and layout (using Flexbox, Grid, and other CSS techniques).
- JavaScript (if required for interactivity).

2. **Design Previews**  
   Links to the design files that show how the solution compares to the intended design, as well as how the solution looks on mobile devices and with active states. You can view:

- Desktop design preview.
- Mobile design preview.
- Active states design preview (for interactive elements like hover, focus, and click).

3. **Deployed Sites**  
   If the project is deployed, you will find a link to the live site where you can interact with the fully functional version of the project.

4. **Screenshot**  
   A screenshot of the solution to give a quick overview of how the project looks once implemented.
